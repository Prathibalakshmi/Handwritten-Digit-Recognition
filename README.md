HANDWRITTEN DIGIT RECOGNITION
Digit recognition system is the working of a machine to train itself for recognizing the digits from different sources like emails, bank cheque, papers, images, etc. and in different realworld scenarios for online handwriting recognition on computer tablets or system. Developing such a system includes a machine to understand and classify the images of handwritten digits as 10 digits (0â€“9). Handwritten digits from the MNIST database has been one of the most famous databases among the machine learning community for many recent decades.

Question:
Use MNIST dataset to create a classifier for all the 10 digits. First implement the classifier by squeezing the image into a vector and then using a MLP. Now, try the same task using a different machine learning classifier such as an SVM to check the gain in performance by using perceptrons as compared to conventional machine learning techniques

Steps:
- Load and Process the MINIST dataset
- Split the dataset into training and testing
- Normalize the pixel values
- Create the MLP classifier
- Train the MLP classifier
- Predict using the trained classifier
- Calculate accuracy
- Create an SVM Classifier
- Train the Classifier
- Predict using trained classifier
- Calculate accuracy
